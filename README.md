# Theoretical and Empirical Analysis of Sorting Algorithms - Project Overview

## Introduction
This project provides a detailed theoretical and empirical analysis of three fundamental sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort. The analysis includes Big-O notation complexity, pseudocode representation, and empirical testing under various data sizes.

## Key Features

- **Theoretical Analysis**: Discusses the time complexity of each sorting algorithm in Big-O notation to predict performance relative to the dataset size.
- **Empirical Results**: Provides empirical data showing the actual running time of each algorithm when sorting arrays of different sizes (N = 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000).
- **Comparison Metrics**: Compares the three algorithms across different metrics to identify which algorithm performs best under varying conditions.

## Technical Requirements

- **Algorithm Implementation**: Each sorting algorithm is implemented and tested to observe its performance empirically.
- **Data Collection**: Running times are collected for each algorithm across multiple iterations to ensure accuracy and reliability of the results.
- **Analysis Tools**: Uses MATLAB or a similar environment for implementing the algorithms and collecting runtime data.

## Objective
